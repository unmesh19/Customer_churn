# Customer Churn Prediction Project

## Overview

This machine learning project focuses on predicting customer churn, an essential task for businesses aiming to retain their customer base. By analyzing historical customer data, the project employs a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of customers churning.

## Project Structure

... (previous content)

- **Model Training and Evaluation:**
  - Using a Logistic Regression model with a maximum iteration of 100,000.
  - Evaluating the model's accuracy on the test set.
  - Generating predictions.

- **Handling Data Imbalance:**
  - Trying two methods to address data imbalance:
    1. Reducing the number of 'no churn' instances to match 'yes churn.' (Accuracy: 79%)
    2. Creating more 'yes churn' instances by duplicating existing instances. (Accuracy: 81%)

- **Conclusion:**
  - Assessing the effectiveness of data balancing techniques.
  - Recognizing that data imbalance may not significantly impact results.
